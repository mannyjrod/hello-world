Hello fellow humans!

A little bit about my ambition -- I plan on going to outer space! Why? Not because it's something that would be comfortable to do, nor do I necessarily want to leave the comfort of 1G - but because I HAVE to. Ever since I was a child I wanted to be a pilot. What cooler craft to pilot than a spacecraft? I have to do this because what better way for me to contribute to the betterment of the planet than to give inspiration? This is why I must do this.
